This mod will help you keep your inventory just sorted or sorted in rows or columns.

It will replenish your hot bar so you can just continue building.

It will replace your almost broken tools with fresh one from your inventory.

Just wanna dump everything in that chest? We got you covered, it's a single click.

Organizing stuff is hard! With one click we can move only items you already have in that chest.

Wanna keep you inventory neat and organized. We can lock items in place and sorting won't affect them.

Tired of picking up junk! We'll keep your locked slots empty for you!

**Press R+C** set your shortcuts, and you are good to go.

**Pure client side! Works on any server!** Even if they try to prevent us! Checkout the advanced options.
