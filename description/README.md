# Inventory Profiles Next's description

This is the description meant to appear on CurseForge.

## Requirements

To build the HTML, you'll need the following:

- [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html)
- [pypandoc](https://pypi.org/project/pypandoc/)
- [premailer](https://pypi.org/project/premailer/)

## Building

To build the html, just run `build_html.py`. The html will be put in the `output.html` file.

## Contributing

If you want to modify the content, you only need to modify `description.md`. 

If you need to add a class, for example for changing the text color or other CSS things, you can do so in `style.css`.

You'll probably not have to modify `build_html.py`
